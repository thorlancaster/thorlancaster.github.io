12/1;4:30 PM;Brockton;[WW] Brockton;Last year, the Redhawk varsity girls basketball team defeated the Brockton Warriors 82-12. It was far from a close game, but was closer than this year's. This time around, The Redhawks totally annihilated the Brockton Lady Warriors <strong>102-0</strong>.<br/><br/>The stats and scores were not reported online for either game.<br/>The girls' game was a total blowout. Despite the lack of stats, it's safe to assume that everyone on the team scored, and most scored multiple times.<br/>$scoreboardButton [First half only]<br/><br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/><br/>For the boys' game, the unstoppable post duo of Nick Eylander and Sean Robinson, combined with good offensive strategy, proved to be more than Brockton could handle. Nick and Sean together scored the majority of our team's points, and Walker Ator and Colt Miller scored a fair amount of points, too. The score was about 46-32.<br/>
12/2;2:30 PM;LAKE;[LLL] Poplar;The Redhawk Varsity girls team started this game off badly, digging themselves a deep hole. After playing Brockton, they were woefully unprepared. Nevertheless, they brought the lead down and built one of their own. As the game went on, the Redhawk lead stayed at around 5-10 points. However, Poplar came back and won the game with 5 points in the final 10 seconds.<br/><br/>12-18, 24-11, 11-17, 7-10, 54-56 final<br/><br/>Sidney Labatte: 4 points<br/>Sydney Dethman: 7 points<br/>Tawnee Robertson: 15 points<br/>Morgan Mason: 9 points<br/>Mackenzie Dethman: 19 points<br/><br/>$scoreboardButton Girls Varsity<br/><br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/><br/>The Redhawk Varsity boys team started this game off very badly, with a 4-20 deficit. However, they fought back and brought the lead down to as low as 6 in the 4th quarter. Nevertheless, Poplar won the game by 12 points after a string of turnovers by the Redhawks.<br/>   Take away the first quarter, and the Redhawks would have won.<br/><br/>8-24, 19-10, 9-13, 22-23, 58-70 final.<br/><br/>Jordan Trupe: 4 points<br/>Colt Miller: 16 points<br/>Nick Eylander: 5 points<br/>Walker Ator: 6 points<br/>Sean Robinson: 22 points<br/>Chance Parsons 5 points<br/><br/>Live scores and stats will be available for games after winter break, starting with Bainville on Jan. 6
12/8;4:30 PM;LAKE;[LWL] MonDak;The Redhawk varsity girls team blew MonDak away with surprising ease, with plenty of easy layups for Mackenzie Dethman, Sydney Labatte, Sydney Dethman, and others. The score started out as a 20-3 blowout, and definitely didn't get any closer.<br/>20-3, 16-5, 14-14, ??-??, ??-?? final<br/><br/>Per-player stats not available.<br/><br/>$scoreboardButton Girls Varsity<br/><br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/><br/>The Redhawk Varsity boys game was a close one, with the lead flip-flopping many times. Mondak ultimately won the game by 4 points, however, due to Redhawk turnovers. The Redhawks had 7 turnovers in the first quarter alone.<br/><br/>The final score was 48-52.<br/><br/>Per-player stats not available.<br/><br/>
12/9;4:30 PM;LAKE;[LWL] Scobey;The Redhawk varsity girls team played a close game with Scobey, but ended up prevailing in the end. Turnovers occurred, especialy at the beginning, shots were missed, and calls did not go our way. The Redhawks fought through it, however, and ended up winning the game.<br/>11-9, 13-17, 16-0, ??-??, ??-?? final<br/><br/>Per-player stats not available from 406mtsports.<br/><br/>$scoreboardButton Girls Varsity<br/><br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/><br/>The Redhawk Varsity boys game was close until the half, but then Scobey picked off a bunch of passes and built a huge lead. Sean injured his MCL (Knee) in the first quarter as a result of a cheap foul, and was out for the rest of the game. I hope that he is able to play next weekend, when we play Plentywood and Culbertson, but it won't be the absolute end of the world if he cannot play.<br/><br/>14-11, 18-14, 19-12, 22-4, 73-41 final<br/><br/>Isaac Johnson: 4 points<br/>Jordan Trupe: 11 points<br/>Colt Miller: 9 points<br/>Nick Eylander: 10 points<br/>Walker Ator: 1 point<br/>Sean Robinson: 2 points<br/>Chance Parsons: 4 points <br/><br/>Live scores and stats will be available for all home and maybe Froid games after winter break, starting with Bainville on Jan. 6. They may be available earlier. As of this writing, all that is left for the Java scoreboard is internet connectivity.
12/15;4:30 PM;FROID;[WWL] Frazer;The Varsity girls game between the Redhawks and the Bearcubs was expected, by many, to be a good, competitive game. One of Frazer's athletes, Mya four star, even had cameras pointed her way, as she had been scoring over 40 points per game. Nevertheless, the Redhawk defense was overwhelming, and the Bearcubs were bested by a very wide margin, with a 40 point Redhawk lead going into the 4th quarter.<br/><br/>Per-player stats not available from 406mtsports for either this game or the boys game.<br/><br/>$scoreboardButton Girls Varsity<br/><br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/><br/>The Redhawk Varsity boys game was close at first, with Frazer posessing a slim 3-point lead at halftime. After halftime, however, Frazer rapidly extended the lead to 12 points as a result of Redhawk turnovers, missed shots, and bad rebounding. However, the Redhawks did not give up, and brought the score within 3 points in the 4th quarter. Right after that, the Redhawks suffered another slew of turnovers and the game slipped away. Frazer ended up winning the game by 9 points.<br/>  Frazer's crowd was the worst that I have probably ever seen, with loud booing after nearly every call that didn't go their way and screaming during nearly every one of our free throws. The Redhawks missed more free throws than they made this game.<br/>  I hope that Sean Robinson's knee gets better. Our team missed him.<br/><br/><br/>No per-quarter scores available.<br/>No per-player stats available.
12/21;4:30 PM;Plentywood;[WLL] Plentywood;The Varsity girls team lost to the Plentywood wildcats by a score of 29-41. The Redhawks had quite a few offensive hiccups this game and struggled to score the ball, especially during the first half. During the second half, the Redhawk offense heated up, but Plentywood's heated up more.<br/><br/>6-4, 4-5, 7-13, 12-19, 29-41 final<br/><br/>Tawnee Robertson: 2 points<br/>Morgan Mason: 11 points<br/>Mackenzie Dethman: 16 points<br/><br/>Live Scores are not available.<br/><br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/><br/>The Varsity Boys team lost to Plentywood in a first-half debacle of turnovers and missed opportunities. Many of the turnovers resulted in fast breaks and easy layups for Plentywood, leading to a halftime deficit that the Redhawks never recovered from. The Plentywood offense was also on fire, and was hitting jump shots all game.<br/><br/>6-21, 12-20, 13-10, 13-18, 44-69 final<br/><br/>
12/22;4:30 PM;LAKE;[WWL] Culbertson;The Redhawk varsity girls team fixed their offensive hiccups and blew past the Culbertson Cowgirls with a final score of 61-37. They were much better offensively than during the previous night's game and outscored Culbertson all 4 quarters.<br/><br/>13-6, 11-6, 17-13, 20-12, 61-37 final<br/>Sydney Labatte: 6 points <br/>Sydney Dethman: 18 points<br/>Tawnee Robertson: 6 points<br/>Morgan Mason: 10 points<br/>Mackenzie Dethman: 17 points<br/>Haley Labatte: 17 points<br/>Kinsey Rasumussen: 4 points<br/><br/>$scoreboardButton Girls Varsity [First Three Quarters]<br/><br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/><br/>The Redhawk Varsity boys game was just as bad as the previous night's game, turnover wise. Worse, most of the turnovers occurred away from the basket, giving Culbertson easy layup after easy layup. The Redhawks' free throw shooting was fairly good, with 21 of 28 free throws made.<br/>8-11, 7-17, 13-11, 15-20, 43-59 final<br/><br/>Isaac Johnson: 3 points<br/>Jordan Trupe: 11 points<br/>Colt Miller: 11 points<br/>Nick Eylander: 4 points<br/>Ayden Hobbs: 7 points <br/>Walker Ator: 7 points<br/><br/>These scores are the correct ones, straight from the book. 406mtsports has it wrong.
1/6;3:00 PM;Bainville;[LWL] Bainville;The Redhawk JV Boys lost 36-59.

1/12;3:00 PM;Fairview;[LWL] Fairview;The Redhawk Boys Varsity team struggled to score against Fairview and had many turnovers.<br/><br/>5-19, 5-7, 8-14, 9-12, 27-52 final<br/><br/>Isaac Johnson: 3 points<br/>Jordan Trupe: 5 points<br/>Ayden Hobbs: 8 points<br/>Colt Miller: 4 points<br/>Nick Eylander: 2 points<br/>Jade Waters: 5 points<br/><br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/><br/>The Redhawk Girls Varsity team played a close game against Fairview, at first. At halftime, the score was a close 23-20, with the Redhawks in the lead. Next, in the third quarter, Fairview didn't score a point as the Redhawks rolled along, scoring several fast break layups and cleaning Fairview's clock.<br/><br/>Box scores are not available from the Gazette, but the Redhawks won in a blowout victory.<br/><br/>$scoreboardButton="Girls Varsity" [For the first half]<br/><br/><br/>
1/13;1:00 PM;FROID;[WWL] Richey-Lambert;The Boys JV team defeated the Richey-Lambert JV team by a score of around 40something to 20something. No live graph available.<br/><br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/><br/>The Girls Varsity game was close at the beginning, but then the Redhawks caught fire and whipped Richey-Lambert. At the end of the first quarter, it was only a 6-point game, but it was a 15-point game by halftime. By the end of the game, it was a 53-25 blowout.<br/><br/>Sydney Labatte: 4 points<br/>Sydney Dethman: 14 points<br/>Tawnee Robertson: 12 points<br/>Morgan Mason: 5 points<br/>Mackenzie Dethman: 14 points<br/>Haley Labatte: 4 points<br/><br/>$scoreboardButton="Girls Varsity" [First half only]<br/><br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/><br/>At halftime, the Boys Varsity game did not look at all good for the Redhawks. The Richey-Lambert lead was 20 points, and not much was occurring offensively. However, in the second half, the Redhawks began running a different offense, consisting of a quick screen and pass to the wing on the side. That offense, combined with much improved hustle and on-point shooting, brought the lead down to within 7 points in the 4th quarter. The Redhawks ultimately lost that game.<br/><br/>4-12, 14-22, 6-4, 20-15, 44-53 final<br/>Isaac Johnson: 9 points<br/>Jordan Trupe: 6 points<br/>Ayden Hobbs: 9 points<br/>Colt Miller: 5 points<br/>Nick Eylander: 6 points<br/>Walker Ator: 5 points<br/>Jade Waters: 4 points<br/><br/><br/><br/>For upcoming games, I will be doing live score for the games differently. A camera will be pointed at the scoreboard, and a picture will be sent out every ten seconds. In the future, I might even be able to use OCR to read numbers off of the scoreboard.
1/16;4:30 PM;FROID;[WW] Brockton;This time around, the Redhawk Varsity girls played a minimal amount of defense and let Brockton shoot the ball without closing out much. Still, it was a blowout victory. <a href="http://billingsgazette.com/sports/high-school/basketball/girls/froid-lake-star-appreciates-the-chance-to-play-and-cheer/article_d2940384-4695-54ed-bf18-0e858c6d768d.html">Morgan Mason Even Made the Gazette.</a><br/><br/>Box scores are not available.<br/><br/>$scoreboardButton="Girls Varsity" [First Half]<br/><br/><br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/><br/>For the first few minutes, the boys varsity game was a close one, but that rapidly changed as the Redhawk press began to exhaust Brockton. By the end of the first quarter, the score was 12-21 in Medicine Lake's favor. It could have been much more of a blowout had the Redhawks made their layups consistently.<br/>The second quarter was another win for the Redhawks, as we outscored them 18-11 and finished the half 39-23. Making short shots annd layups were still an issue, however.<br/>By the middle of the third quarter, Brockton's hopes were quickly evaporating. Hard-pressing Froid-Lake scored 19 points, while Brockton only scored 3. By the end of the game, it was a 41-point, 33-74 blowout, the largest margin of victory for the boys' team in at least 4 years.<br/><br/><br/>21-12, 18-11, 19-3, 16-7, 74-33 final<br/><br/>Colt Miller: 21 points<br/>Jordon Trupe: 11 points<br/>Thor Lancaster: 8 points<br/>Jade Waters: 8 points<br/>Nick Eylander: 8 points<br/>Walker Ator: 7 points<br/>Chance Parsons: 6 points<br/>Isaac Johnson: 5 points
1/19;3:00 PM;Frazer;[WWL] Frazer;<br/>The Redhawk Junior Varsity Boys team blew Frazer away by about 30 points. We full-court pressed at the beginning, and Frazer had no answer. Once they got trapped in the corner, they couldn't get out. Frazer's offense was not the best, either.<br/>On the other end of the court, the Redhawks also dominated.

Choking during the second quarter, they only scored three points to Plentywood's twelve and dug themselves into a 9-point hole by halftime. The Redhawks rallied after halftime and scored 18 points in the third quarter, gaining a three-point lead. In the fourth quarter, Plentywood's 8-5 scoring run left the game tied up, and the game went into overtime.<br/><br/>As the overtime drew to a close, the Redhawks held onto a 3-point lead with a little over a minute remaining. They turned the ball over, and Plentywood took off down the court and the shooter was fouled. Their shooter made both free throws, bringing the Redhawk lead down to one point. Plentywood scored again, and the clock ran out before any more points were scored.

Fast forward to the 4th quarter. After falling into a significant hole, the Redhawks were up 33-30 with under a minute remaining. Unfortunately, they mixed up the defense and allowed Mondak a wide-open three. The 4th quarter ended as a 33-33 tie, and the game went into overtime.<br/>The Redhawks missed a crucial score when Mackenzie drew a charge while making a layup.

2/12;3:00 PM;Sidney;[Win] Game 1 Vs. Circle;For the first 5 minutes, absolutely nothing happened. There were many shots taken, many airballs, and no scores. Circle then scored the first point, but that was the extent of their short-lived lead.<br/>By halftime, as both offenses stuttered, the score was 16-8. In the third quarter, however, the full-court press sank in and Circle cracked. Scoring 12 unanswered points, the Redhawks made the Wildcats suck on a nebulizer and blew them away by a large margin.<br/><br/>16-8 first half, 37-23 second half, 53-31 final<br/><br/><br/>

2/16;9:00 AM;Sidney;[Win] Game 3 Vs.Plentywood;From the beginning, this was a good game for the Redhawks. Bode Miller made the opening three, and the Redhawks never looked back, gaining a 15-point lead by halftime. Plentywood picked up the pressure in the second half and brought the led down to as low as six, but a bonus situation and Plentywood fouling cemented the victory.<br/><br/>14-11, 18-6, 5-11, 19-15, 56-43 final<br/><br/>Javonne Nesbit: 15 points<br/>Jordon Trupe: 11 points<br/>Ayden Hobbs: 3 points<br/>Colt Miller: 5 points<br/>Bode Miller: 13 points<br/>Nick Eylander: 6 points<br/>Walker Ator: 3 points<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
2/17;10:00 AM;Sidney;[Loss] Game 4 Vs. Savage;At the beginning, it looked like the Redhawks had this one on the bag. They had a 10 point lead, the offense was working, and Savage struggled to score. Unfortunately, Savage had all but eliminated the lead by halftime and the score was all tied up. Coming out of the half, Savage caught fire and the Redhawks struggled, and Savage built up a substantial lead. As the game drew to a close, the Redhaws cut down the lead, but Savage held on and won by 3 points.<br/><br/>I do not have stats, but here is an approximate graph of the score:<br/><br/><span style="font-family: monospace"><br/>Savage Lead ---- TIED ---- Redhawk Lead<br/>                  |                    <br/>                    |                  <br/>                      |                <br/>                     |                    <br/>                       |                    <br/>                         |                    <br/>                      |                    <br/>                  |                    <br/>                 |                    <br/>                 |                    <br/>               |                    <br/>             |                    <br/>              |                    <br/>              |                    <br/>                |                    <br/>                 |<br/></span>
2/19;6:00 PM;Culbertson;[Win] Game 5 Vs. Bainville;As the game got going, things did not look too well for the Redhawks. The score was 1-9 at one point, and layups were being badly doinked. As the first quarter wound down and the second quarter wound up, the Redhawks demolished Bainille's lead and built one of their own. By halftime, the Redhawk lead was 3 points. In the third quarter, the Redhawks choked a little, but they held on. Pulling ahead in the final minutes, they held on and won by 8. Javonne Nesbit was spectacular, scoing 29 points including a crucial string of free throws in the 4th quarter to seal the game.<br/><br/>4-9, 15-7, 10-14, 18-9, 47-39 final<br/><br/><br/>Javonne Nesbit: 29 points<br/>Colt Miller: 5 points<br/>Bode Miller: 4 points<br/>Nick Eylander: 6 points<br/>Walker Ator: 2 points

2/15;7:30 PM;Sidney;[Win] Game 1 Vs. Richey-Lambert;The whistle blew. The clock started. The Redhawks got into their rhythm. What happened next was an almost unimaginable blowout, as the Redhawks scored bucket after bucket after bucket. The scoring was so rapid that I struggled to keep my scoreboard updated during the 2nd quarter at times. By halftime, the Redhawks had scored a total of 35 points compared with R$ANDL's 4.<br/>The second half, the Redhawks put the bench in, relaxed, and had fun.

2/16;7:30 PM;Sidney;[Loss] Game 2 Vs. Savage;At the beginnning, the Redhawks looked like they had this one in the bag. The offense was running smoothly there were points being scored by both teams, and the score was all tied up at the end of the first quarter. Next, as sometimes happens, the Redhawks choked. Badly. The Redhawks still kept getting open looks, but blew at least 20 points on badly doinked layups and free throws.

2/22;1:30 PM;Wolf Point;[Win] Game 1 Vs. North Country;From the beginning, this game was a nebulization. After a few early hiccups, they got into their rythym and a nonstop barrage of scoring and stealing the ball resulted. At one point, the score was 23-0.

2/22;3:00 PM;Wolf Point;[Win] Game 2 Vs. Savage;As the game got going, things were not looking good. Wide-open layups were being blown, and Savage was managing to score. At one point in the first quarter, the score was 3-8 in Savage's favor. <br/>  Throughout most of the game, the lead fluctuated back and forth, with neither team gaining a significant one. <br/>  Late in the game, the game changed. The Redhawks started making their layups, and gained a large lead. Savage started fouling, and... ...<strong>The Redhawks are probably going to STATE!!!</strong><br/><br/>7-11, 17-14, 14-10, 16-9, 54-44 final<br/><br/><br/>$scoreboardButton="Girls Varsity"<br/><br/><br/>Haley Labatte: 2 points<br/>Sydney Labatte: 7 points<br/>Sydney Dethman: 13 points<br/>Mackenzie Dethman: 19 points<br/>Tawnee Robertson: 4 points<br/>Morgan Mason: 9 points<br/>
2/24;7:00 PM;Wolf Point;[Win] CHAMPIONSHIP Vs. Plentywood;Early on, things did not look good for the Redhawks. They struggled to retain posession of the ball, and Plentywood had no trouble hitting their shots. Nevertheless, the Redhawks perservered, and the Redhawks had a onr-point lead going into halftime. In the second half, the Redhawks were unstoppable, scoring relentlessly and constantly stealing the ball.<br/><br/>I predict Savage to win the challenge game because Plentywood cracks under pressure and Savage doesn't.<br/><br/>The Redhawks also earned their first first-place divisional trophy in eight years. <strong>They have also officially made it to state!</strong><br/><br/><br/>$scoreboardButton="Girls Varsity"<br/>

2/21;2:30 PM;Wolf Point;[Loss] Game 1 Vs. Fairview;As this game got going, things were looking good for the Redhawks. Press breaker was working and the score was fairly close. As the first quarter came to an end, the Redhawks sat on a 2-point lead... until Fairview hit a 3-pointer in the closing seconds.<br/>  After that, everything fell apart. Turnovers occurred against the press, and Fairview built up a big lead.

2/22;9:00 AM;Wolf Point;[Win] Game 2 Vs. Savage;This game was close until the final buzzer. The Redhakws built up a lead by halftime, and then lost it in the 4th quarter. The lead changed hands several times, and the scores were withing one point of each other as the final seconds ticked off. Savage had the ball, and Nick Moore was driving in for a layup to give Savage the lead and end the game...... until Javonne swatted him. The crowd went wild, but Savage maintained Possession. the Redhawks got the ball back with a couple of seconds left and inbounded it. They held on to the ball until the clock ran out, and won the game.<br/><br/>No stats available.
2/22;10:30 AM;Wolf Point;[Win] Game 3 Vs. Frazer;As the game got going, things did not look good for the Redhawks. Frazer had an early lead, and held on to it throughout the half. It was about to become the last game of the year for the boys.<br/>Braydon Jackson got a Technical foul, and everything changed. Frazer's shooting became ice cold, and the Redhawks got out their nebulizer. After 15 unanswered points, Frazer's 8-point lead was all but gone and the Redhawks had an eight-point one of their own.<br/>   Frazer was mad. Their carefully laid plans were going south quickly. Even slapping Colt and Javonne as they drove in (which should have been called fouls) did nothing. Frazer made a few more buckets, but the Redhawks held on and made crucial free throws despite the frazer crowd booing... and WON THE GAME!!!!!<br/><br/><br/>8-12, 13-17, 20-5, 15-18, 56-52 final<br/><br/><br/>Javonne Nesbit: 19 points<br/>Jordan Trupe: 5 points<br/>Colt Miller: 19 points<br/>Nick Eylander: 11 points<br/>Walker Ator: 4 points<br/>
2/22;6:00 PM;Wolf Point;[Loss,Final] Game 4 Vs. Mondak ;No matter which way that this one went, it was bound to be the last game of the season. The loser of this game is 4th place, and the winner is 3rd.<br/>As this game got going, Mondak built up an early 10-point lead as Jack Solberg hit a bunch of threes and Jerimiah Paine hit several jumpers. The Redhawks fought back, with Javonne Nesbit and Colt Miller hitting a bunch of shots, as well as a few from Walker Ator, Nick Eylander. Mondak held their 10-point lead throughout most of the game and ended up winning by 12.<br/><br/>I do not have stats for this game, but they weren't much different from the previous ones.

3/8;12:30 PM;Butte;[Win] Game 1 Vs. Harlowton;This game was a blowout from the very beginning. Our tall post players simply passed the ball over the opposing team's head and scored basket after basket.

3/9;6:30 PM;Butte;[Loss] Game 2 Vs. Box Elder;As this one got going, it looked like another blowout. The Redhawks had an early lead and were shooting extremely well from all areas of the court. The early-game Redhawk press also forced a lot of turnovers.<br/>After the first quarter, the Redhawks lost their edge. They struggled to score for long periods, and Box Elder's inside-out offense kept hitting shots. Unable to slow Box Elder's well-rounded offense, the Redhawks lost 41-54. but still have a shot at third place.<br/><br/><br/>$scoreboardButton="Girls Varsity"<br/><br/><br/>Sydney Labatte: 6 points<br/>Tawnee Robertson: 6 points<br/>Morgan Mason: 6 points<br/>Mackenzie Dethman: 11 points<br/>Haley Labatte: 5 points<br/>Sydney Dethman: 7 points<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
3/10;9:30;Butte;[Win] Game 3 Vs. Ennis [LOSER OUT];The game started out as a close one, but Ennis went on a scoring run and the game was not looking good for the Redhawks. Ennis had a 21-12 lead and was scoring at will. They had been shooting threes, making them, and stopping the Redhawks. Since that game was loser-out, the Redhawks would go home immediately and get home sometime after midnight. Nevertheless, the Redhawks perservered and managed to get the deficit down to a single point at halftime. After a long battle in which the lead changed several times, the Redhawks came through and won the game. They now have a shot at 3<sup>rd</sup> or 4<sup>th</sup> place.<br/><br/>10-11, 11-11, 8-4, 8-7, 37-33 final<br/><br/>$scoreboardButton="Girls Varsity"<br/><br/>Sydney Labatte: 5 points<br/>Sidney Dethmam: 6 points<br/>Tawnee Robertson: 3 points<br/>Morgan Mason: 8 points<br/>Haley Labatte: 5 points<br/>Mackenzie Dethman: 9 points<br/><br/><br/>

With a jump-shot from Morgan Mason and a free throw from Haley Labatte, the Redhawks obtained the lead. Points were traded back and forth, and the Redhawk lead stayed between 1 and 6 points for most of the game. Led by Kailee Oliverson's 17 points and multiple shot-blocks, Twin Bridges rallied back and gained a one-point lead around halfway through the 4th quarter. Twin Bridges began fouling to get the ball back near the end, and the Redhawks converted on their free throws. 41-34 was the final score, with the Redhawks victorious.<br/><br/>The Redhawks earned a 3<sup>rd</sup> place trophy, their first state trophy in a long time.<br/><br/><br/>$scoreboardButton="Girls Varsity"<br/><br/>
