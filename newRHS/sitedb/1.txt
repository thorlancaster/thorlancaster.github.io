10/22;--;--;Thoughts on the season;It has been a fun 3 years running cross country for Medicine Lake. The courses are fun to run on, and the scenery is generally pretty nice.<br/>This year, my times have not been the best. I have gained 20 pounds since last season, and I generally lose position near the end of the race.<br/>However, my first-mile times have been around or under 6 minutes. The mile will be my best race this year. I hope to finally make it to state for track.<br/><br/>It is not just the end of my Cross Country career, it is the end of an era. Mr. Webster will no longer be able to coach, as his son is going into Kindergarten next year. Additionally, With Tawnee's and my graduation, there will be no more runners. I am looking forward to basketball, as I have improved quite a bit since last year.<br/>
