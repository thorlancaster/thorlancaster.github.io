8/26;1:00 PM;LAKE;[0-36 Loss] Terry;The Redhawks lost <span style="font-size: 200%">0-36</span> against the Terriers. It was not a good start, but it was way better than last year. Last year, we lost by over 50 points. The team needs to stop gambling and start kicking field goals. If they would have done that, the score would have been more like 36-14. Terry is a good team, and the Redhawks have a good chance of beating Richey-Lambert for homecoming.

Throughout the first three quarters, the Redhawks totally dominated the game, including a pick-6 that went 90 yards for a touchdown.<br/><br/>Live scores are not available because I was doing chains for the game.

10/7;1:00 PM;LAKE;[6-46 Loss] Mondak;At first, this game looked promising for the Redhawks. During the opening plays, the Redhawks caught two straight interceptions, got some first downs, and were looking at a touchdown with less than a minute left. The next play, Brandom Meade broke his arm. The Redhawks went on to score the touchdown, but the rest of the half was one sided as Mondak racked up 46 straight points. During the second half, there were no points scored. Mondak came close to scoring a few touchdowns, but the Redhawks stopped them every time. The Redhawks managed to get close enough to kick a field goal, but it was no good.<br/>   I sure hope that Brandon is able to play VS. Ekalaka. I would love to see a home victory this year.<br/><br/>Froid-Lake Redhawks: 6<br/>Mondak Thunder: 46<br/>

10/22;--;--;Thoughts on the season;This has not been a good year for the Medicine Lake high school football team. The Redhawks finished the season with 8 losses and one win. I have seen them play and attribute the record to bad coaching and not enough speed. The offense has only a couple of plays that they run, and the other team catches on fairly quickly and can easily defend all of them.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the season, the coaches were going to make a playbook with plays to run. That never happened.<br/>Near the end of the season, vs. Mondak, Brandon Meade broke his arm. He was one of our better players. Bummer.<br/><br/>On the bright side, we have a successful Junior High football program. Their coach, Michael Ryder, knows what he is doing. The Junior high team has many options for their plays and win the majority of their games.<br/><br/>To start things off right for the next season, we need better coaches. If you are coach Ryder or coach Stentoft, I encourage you to apply. We need you.
