		<site-data id="seasonData1" style="display: none">9/1;10:00 AM;Wolf Point;Wolf Point;Weather:<br/>    When we arrived at Wolf point, it was hot and humid. The high was 85¬∞ and the humidity was 75%. There were few clouds.<br/>Course Conditions:<br/>    The course was mostly flat, about 50% grass and 50% gravel. There was a small hill near the end. Total elevation change was around 20 feet throughout the course.<br/><br/>Results:<br/>    Thor Lancaster: 20:21, 14th place.<br/>    Chloe Taylor: Did not compete due to knee injury.<br/>    Tawnee Robertson: Did not compete due to not having enough practices according to MHSA rules.
9/22;2:00 PM;Sidney;Sidney;Weather:<br/>    When we arrived at Sidney, it was cold and moderately windy, with 5-10MPH winds and a temperature of around 45 degrees. This year, the course was configured to be hillier than last year.<br/><br/>Thor: 21:00<br/>Tawnee: 25:57
9/26;4:00 PM;Culbertson;Culbertson;Culbertson was a fairly easy course, with no hills. It was mostly gravel.<br/><br/>Thor 19:57<br/>Tawnee 22:55
9/28;4:00 PM;Richey;Richey;Richey is a fun cross country course to run. It starts with a small hill, but is mostly downhill from there. It is mostly pavement. The temperature was 71 degrees at the time of the races.<br/><br/>Thor: 20:10, 9th overall, RIBBON<br/>Tawnee: 23:37, 8th overall, RIBBON
9/30;10:00 AM;Fort Peck;Glasgow;Glasgow is one of the best cross country courses in the district. The course is near the Fort Peck dam and the scenery is beautiful. The weather was also perfect for a cross country race. There were a few clouds and the temperature was around 68 degrees.<br/>    On the other hand, there was one bad thing about the course. The bathrooms at the course smelled <strong>AWFUL</strong>. If someone were to have thrown a match into one of the outhouses, an explosion would likely have occurred.<br/><br/>Thor Lancaster: 19:54, 28th place<br/>Tawnee Robertson: ?23:00?, 14th place, RIBBON<br/>
10/14;10:00 AM;Plentywood;Plentywood;The Plentywood XC meet is on a golf course, and is relatively hilly. It is the second hilliest course in the district, behind Sidney's. Many weather sites predicted snow, but they were dead wrong. There was no snow at all, and there was not a cloud in the sky. The temperature was around 55 degrees.<br/><br/>Thor Lancaster: 20:04, 17th place<br/>Tawnee Robertson: 23:32, 11th place
10/21;10:00 AM;Helena;State;This year's state cross country meet was held at Bill Roberts Golf course in Helena, Montana, elevation 3,920 feet. The temperature was about 55 degrees with 15 mph winds. The course was moderately hilly.<br/><br/>Results:<br/>Thor Lancaster: 21:12, TBAth place of 128 runners<br/>Tawnee Robertson was gone for national FFA.
10/22;--;--;Thoughts on the season;It has been a fun 3 years running cross country for Medicine Lake. The courses are fun to run on, and the scenery is generally pretty nice.<br/>This year, my times have not been the best. I have gained 20 pounds since last season, and I generally lose position near the end of the race.<br/>However, my first-mile times have been around or under 6 minutes. The mile will be my best race this year. I hope to finally make it to state for track.<br/><br/>It is not just the end of my Cross Country career, it is the end of an era. Mr. Webster will no longer be able to coach, as his son is going into Kindergarten next year. Additionally, With Tawnee's and my graduation, there will be no more runners. I am looking forward to basketball, as I have improved quite a bit since last year.<br/></site-data>
		<site-data id="seasonData2" style="display: none">8/26;1:00 PM;LAKE;[0-36 Loss] Terry;The Redhawks lost <span style="font-size: 200%">0-36</span> against the Terriers. It was not a good start, but it was way better than last year. Last year, we lost by over 50 points. The team needs to stop gambling and start kicking field goals. If they would have done that, the score would have been more like 36-14. Terry is a good team, and the Redhawks have a good chance of beating Richey-Lambert for homecoming.
9/2;1:00 PM;Wibaux;[0-53 Loss] Wibaux;The Redhawks lost <span style="font-size: 200%">0-53</span> against Wibaux, one of the best teams in the conference. Detailed stats were not reported.<br/><br/>
9/5;4:00 PM;LAKE;[JH] [39-13 Win] MonDak;This year, our Junior High football team is looking promising. They beat MonDak <span style="font-size: 200%">39-13</span>. Throughout the first three quarters, the Redhawks totally dominated the game, including a pick-6 that went 90 yards for a touchdown.<br/><br/>Live scores are not available because I was doing chains for the game.
9/8;7:00 PM;Jordan;[13-50? Loss] Jordan;Jade Waters scored the first 2 touchdowns of the season.<br/>The score was about <span style="font-size: 200%">50-something to 13</span>.
9/16;1:00 PM;LAKE;[6-67 Loss] Richey/Lambert;The Redhawks lost <span style="font-size: 200%">6-67.</span><br/><br/>Quarter 1: Redhawks 6, Fusion 14<br/>Quarter 2: Redhawks 0, Fusion 20<br/>Quarter 3: Redhawks 0, Fusion 10<br/>Quarter 4: Redhawks 0, Fusion 23<br/><br/>The junior high won this game by about fiftysomething to 13.
9/22;7:00 PM;Savage;[Lost by 69] Savage;The Redhawks scored some touchdowns, Savage scored way more. No scores are available, but we lost by <span style="font-size: 200%">69</span> points.
9/30;1:00 PM;Alexander ND;[46-16 Win] Alexander;The Redhawks blew away Alexander 46-16 on Saturday. This was the Redhawk football team's first victory this season. Alexander is yet to win a game.
10/7;1:00 PM;LAKE;[6-46 Loss] Mondak;At first, this game looked promising for the Redhawks. During the opening plays, the Redhawks caught two straight interceptions, got some first downs, and were looking at a touchdown with less than a minute left. The next play, Brandom Meade broke his arm. The Redhawks went on to score the touchdown, but the rest of the half was one sided as Mondak racked up 46 straight points. During the second half, there were no points scored. Mondak came close to scoring a few touchdowns, but the Redhawks stopped them every time. The Redhawks managed to get close enough to kick a field goal, but it was no good.<br/>   I sure hope that Brandon is able to play VS. Ekalaka. I would love to see a home victory this year.<br/><br/>Froid-Lake Redhawks: 6<br/>Mondak Thunder: 46<br/>
10/14;1:00 PM;Bainville;[LOSS] Bainville;
10/21;1:00 PM;LAKE;[14-48] Loss] Ekalaka;
10/22;--;--;Thoughts on the season;This has not been a good year for the Medicine Lake high school football team. The Redhawks finished the season with 8 losses and one win. I have seen them play and attribute the record to bad coaching and not enough speed. The offense has only a couple of plays that they run, and the other team catches on fairly quickly and can easily defend all of them.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the season, the coaches were going to make a playbook with plays to run. That never happened.<br/>Near the end of the season, vs. Mondak, Brandon Meade broke his arm. He was one of our better players. Bummer.<br/><br/>On the bright side, we have a successful Junior High football program. Their coach, Michael Ryder, knows what he is doing. The Junior high team has many options for their plays and win the majority of their games.<br/><br/>To start things off right for the next season, we need better coaches. If you are coach Ryder or coach Stentoft, I encourage you to apply. We need you.

Near the end of the second set, the Redhawks started to make errors, mainly spiking the ball into the net and hitting it out of bounds. The third set ended the same way, with Savage winning by 5. Things got even worse in the 4th set, when Morgan Mason rolled her ankle. When Morgan gets healthy again and the team stops making errors, we will be able to finally beat Savage.<br/><br/>$scoreboardButton

One of Frazer's athletes, Mya four star, even had cameras pointed her way, as she had been scoring over 40 points per game.

However, the Redhawks did not give up, and brought the score within 3 points in the 4th quarter. Right after that, the Redhawks suffered another slew of turnovers and the game slipped away. Frazer ended up winning the game by 9 points.<br/>  Frazer's crowd was the worst that I have probably ever seen, with loud booing after nearly every call that didn't go their way and screaming during nearly every one of our free throws.

Choking during the second quarter, they only scored three points to Plentywood's twelve and dug themselves into a 9-point hole by halftime. The Redhawks rallied after halftime and scored 18 points in the third quarter, gaining a three-point lead. In the fourth quarter, Plentywood's 8-5 scoring run left the game tied up, and the game went into overtime.<br/><br/>As the overtime drew to a close, the Redhawks held onto a 3-point lead with a little over a minute remaining. They turned the ball over, and Plentywood took off down the court and the shooter was fouled. Their shooter made both free throws, bringing the Redhawk lead down to one point. Plentywood scored again, and the clock ran out before any more points were scored.

By the end of the first half, the Redhawks had barely broken 10. Good defense saved the Redhawks, as Mondak struggled to score also. They only had 16 at the half....... ... .. . Fast forward to the 4th quarter. After falling into a significant hole, the Redhawks were up 33-30 with under a minute remaining. Unfortunately, they mixed up the defense and allowed Mondak a wide-open three. The 4th quarter ended as a 33-33 tie, and the game went into overtime.<br/>The Redhawks missed a crucial score when Mackenzie drew a charge while making a layup.

2/12;3:00 PM;Sidney;[Win] Game 1 Vs. Circle;For the first 5 minutes, absolutely nothing happened. There were many shots taken, many airballs, and no scores. Circle then scored the first point, but that was the extent of their short-lived lead.<br/>By halftime, as both offenses stuttered, the score was 16-8. In the third quarter, however, the full-court press sank in and Circle cracked. Scoring 12 unanswered points, the Redhawks made the Wildcats suck on a nebulizer and blew them away by a large margin.<br/><br/>16-8 first half, 37-23 second half, 53-31 final<br/><br/><br/>

2/16;9:00 AM;Sidney;[Win] Game 3 Vs.Plentywood;From the beginning, this was a good game for the Redhawks. Bode Miller made the opening three, and the Redhawks never looked back, gaining a 15-point lead by halftime.

2/17;10:00 AM;Sidney;[Loss] Game 4 Vs. Savage;At the beginning, it looked like the Redhawks had this one on the bag. They had a 10 point lead, the offense was working, and Savage struggled to score. Unfortunately, Savage had all but eliminated the lead by halftime and the score was all tied up. Coming out of the half, Savage caught fire and the Redhawks struggled, and Savage built up a substantial lead.

As the first quarter wound down and the second quarter wound up, the Redhawks demolished Bainille's lead and built one of their own. By halftime, the Redhawk lead was 3 points. In the third quarter, the Redhawks choked a little, but they held on. Pulling ahead in the final minutes, they held on and won by 8.

Frazer's shooting became ice cold, and the Redhawks got out their nebulizer. After 15 unanswered points, Frazer's 8-point lead was all but gone and the Redhawks had an eight-point one of their own.<br/>   Frazer was mad. Their carefully laid plans were going south quickly. Even slapping Colt and Javonne as they drove in (which should have been called fouls) did nothing.

The early-game Redhawk press also forced a lot of turnovers.<br/>After the first quarter, the Redhawks lost their edge.

Ennis had a 21-12 lead and was scoring at will. They had been shooting threes, making them, and stopping the Redhawks. Since that game was loser-out, the Redhawks would go home immediately and get home sometime after midnight. Nevertheless, the Redhawks perservered and managed to get the deficit down to a single point at halftime.

Led by Kailee Oliverson's 17 points and multiple shot-blocks, Twin Bridges rallied back and gained a one-point lead around halfway through the 4th quarter. Twin Bridges began fouling to get the ball back near the end, and the Redhawks converted on their free throws. 41-34 was the final score, with the Redhawks victorious.<br/><br/>The Redhawks earned a 3<sup>rd</sup> place trophy, their first state trophy in a long time.<br/><br/><br/>$scoreboardButton="Girls Varsity"<br/><br/>
